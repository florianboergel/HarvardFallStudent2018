# HarvardFallStudent2018
For students of Harvard CSCI E-96 Fall Session 2018

## Please install the following packages with this R code.
If you encounter any errors don't worry we will find time to work through them.  The `qdap` library is usually the trickiest because it requires Java and `rJava`.  So if you get any errors, try removing that from the code below and rerunning.  This will take **a long time** if you don't already have the packages, so please run prior to class, and at a time you don't need your computer ie *at night*.
```
